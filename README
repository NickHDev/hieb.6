**README**

This OSS Program runs simultaneous processes on a artificial system clock that that has a process control block to store worker processes and it also sends and Receives messages from the processes. We Try to add and remove resources based on requests from childs. 

This program should be run by first compiling using the command "make" in the terminal.

When opening this file in the command line you should just do ./oss with arguments

These arguments include [-h -n -s -i -f] with the optional -h argument in the beginning of the file for a list of helpful tips to run the program.

To run the program an example command would be "./oss -n 5 -s 3 -i 100 -f oss.log" 

There should also be a worker file
To use the worker.exe an example command would be "./worker 1"

[!!CURRENT PROBLEMS!!]
I cannot add the timing for only launching processes at the given interval for -i 
The deadlock recovery function may need alot more more but it tries to get rid of the process with the most resources.

I tried to use the deadlock detection from class but I dont know if its running correctly. It seems to be.
